testing
  input file in the task directory
  output files go to impl directories
  testing script runs everything and diffs files
    set of hashes
      
diff -q --from-file  


execute run.sh in each impl
  it should build and execute

    space stoichiometry
  diffing tool
    diffs multiple files, groups them by similarity

node IO's lags hard
  only rewriting file
  appending to file is fast
why?
