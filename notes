testing
  input file in the task directory
  output files go to impl directories
  testing script runs everything and diffs files
    set of hashes
  makefile(s) so it doesn't run the code that didn't change?
      
diff -q --from-file  


execute run.sh in each impl
  it should build and execute

CL is clunky even with fizzbuzz

diffing tool
  diffs multiple files, groups them by similarity
    seems sick in python! key larger than values
parse test suite
  that's a library
  lib/load_tests.lang

test against stuff from rosetta code

node IO's lags hard
  only rewriting file
  appending to file is fast
why?
